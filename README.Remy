To develop go to devel/js/StatInfJS

1) package.json added for node-webkit use: nw .
2) lib/cqls created to include all the stuff based on opal and createjs.
3) To deploy: 
	.) modifying package.js and index.html (which do not include link to opal.js, cqls.js and main.js)
	.) ./tools.deploy.sh allows us to minify all these js files inside build/app.js
4) TODO: PhoneGap (read README.cordova-phonegap) to create application Android and iOS.
